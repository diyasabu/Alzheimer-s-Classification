# Alzheimer-s-Classification

The objective of this project is to identify and categorize the severity of Alzheimer’s disease. Three distinct models, namely manual net, ResNet, and AlexNet, were employed for this purpose. Subsequently, these models were compared and contrasted, and the findings were documented in a research paper presented at the ICTACC’23.
